# linear-algebra
3rd year computational physics exercise

This exercise was used to investigate various aspects of linear algebra. 

This included using matrix inversion based on Cramer's rule, LU decomposition, and SVD decomposition to explore the time taken to solve randomly generated simultaneous equations.

I also used Rayleigh quotient iteration to find the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a matrix, and applied this to a system of coupled oscillators.
